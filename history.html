<p>During 1519, Mexico was conquered by Spain and the Atzec Empire was overthrown by the Spanish.The Spanish ruled over Mexico for over 300 years from 1519 to 1821. In 1821 Mexico went to war with Spain and fought for their independence which they were able to achieve. However, after Mexico gained independence they had to deal with the government and economy collapsing. The United States saw their weakend state and took the oppurtunity to take their lands in 1846. </p>
